    <div><h2>Upgrading:</h2></div>

    Wifi Fixer will be routinely updated.<br>
    When it is, you will be given a notification by Google Play.<br>
    The process is identical to any other app, you simply tap Update and the app will download and install.<br>
    The service will start itself back up after a while. You don't have to do anything special.<br>
    <br><br>
    <b>Important:</b> If resources in an app are changed, odd behavior can result on update.<br>
    If this happens, either uninstall and reinstall the app, or reboot the device.<br>
